mod_nslmodules
==============

This is an altered version of various nsl opensimulator modules.



To configure the php folder, edit php/include/config.php.

Only the empty variables at the top of the page should be edited unless you feel lucky (with the exception of obvious examples).

To install the database, use php/sql/modnslmodules.sql.

Use php/cron.php for an easier cron job.
